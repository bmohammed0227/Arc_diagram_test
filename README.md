As part of a requested assignment, we had to implement the diagram arc using processing with java.


You can draw the graph directly on the application or by using a 'data.text' file, or a random generation of the graph, then visualize each step with the arrows.

# Draw random graph

You can navigate to last or the first iteration by pressing the right click respectively on the left arrow or the right arrow.

# Draw graph by using the file 'data.txt'

You can enter the graph informations in a file text called 'data.txt', that you must add at the same repository as the main program, the line number represents the position of the node, the first number is the node ID, the last numbers are the neighbors IDs.

Let's take for example this graph

0,1,2

2,4,5,0,1

4,2

5,2

3,1

1,0,2,3


The result will be like that
